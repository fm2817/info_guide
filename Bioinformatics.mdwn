## Basic Programmes for Installation

Most of our anaylsis will be done using R or Command Line language. 
Some steps also involve Python, but in the terminal and is simple to follow. 
Some basic programmes need to be installed (see below) and you will also need 
an account with Imperail HPC and connect to the cluster (more about this later).

* Install the latest version of R [R 3.6.2]
    * https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
* Install RStudio [chooose the free desktop version]
    * https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
* Install Visual Studio Code
    * This is a great addition to RStudio and while I prefer to use RStudio if 
    I am purely coding in R, VSCode enables cross-langauge compatibility and
    Git commands built-in 
    * https://code.visualstudio.com
* Set up a Git Hub account [again choose the free option]
    * https://github.com
* Docker is another nice application to use, however not necessary (???)
