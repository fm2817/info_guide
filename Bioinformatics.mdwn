## Basic Programmes for Installation

Most of our anaylsis will be done using R or Command Line language. 
Some steps also involve Python, but in the terminal and is simple to follow. 
Some basic programmes need to be installed (see below) and you will also need 
an account with Imperail HPC and connect to the cluster (more about this later).

* Install the latest version of R [R 3.6.2]
    * https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
* Install RStudio [chooose the free desktop version]
    * https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
* Install Visual Studio Code
    * This is a great addition to RStudio and while I prefer to use RStudio if 
    I am purely coding in R, VSCode enables cross-langauge compatibility and
    Git commands built-in 
    * https://code.visualstudio.com
* Set up a Git Hub account [again choose the free option]
    * https://github.com
* Docker is another nice application to use, however not necessary (???) 

### Additional Packages

You will also need to install some additional packages in order to run R and RStudio 
correctly and Mac doesn't come with these pre-installed. 

* XQuartz [latest version] 
    * https://www.xquartz.org 
    * > Note: always re-install XQuartz when upgrading to a new major version
* Clang 7.0.0.  
    * https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/ 
* GNU Fortran 6.1
    * https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/ 
    * > Note: you don't need Tcl/Tk as R already comes with it. 
* Command line tools and developer tools:
    1.  Install Xcode [use App Store, you will also need to make a free account]
    2. To install the command line tools: go into Terminal app and use:
            ```{r}
            xcode-select --install
            ```
        This will install the command line tools. Additional info can be found under: https://docs.brew.sh/Installation
    3.  In terminal, use the command:
            ```{r}
            R
            options(menu.graphics=F)
            install.packages("processx")
            ```
        After you hit enter for `install.packages("processx")`, you will see a list of mirrors come up. These basically help download your packages from a closer server. Use the UK - Bristol server [try Bristol first and if it doesn't work then use the UK - London server]. 
        You need this package to install the development tools. Additional info can be found under: https://github.com/r-lib/processx 
    4. In terminal, use the command:
            ```{r}
            install.packages("devtools")
            ```
