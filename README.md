Using the Terminal is a great way to interact with your computer and is recommended to get accoustomed to the syntax and some simple functions will make your life easier. [This](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) is a nice introductory to the Unix Shell. 

> Note: Since Catalina update, please note that the standard Terminal shell is Zsh and not Bash. Most commands should be interchangeable and not impact syntax.
