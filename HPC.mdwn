## Getting Access

You will need to get access to the [Research Computing Service](https://api.rcs.imperial.ac.uk/groups/manage/hpc-access/). Simone already has an account `hpc-sdigiova`. If you are a post-doc, PhD or research postgrad student, you will need to ask Ilaria to register you.

> [Getting started](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/support/getting-started/).

You will also need access to the Imperial network. This is not a must, but VPN can be fishy. In order to do this, you need an ethernet cable and if you need any ethernet - usb adapter, this will need to be registered by ICT. Use ICT Ask to submit tasks to get this sorted. You can also visit them, the office is the basement of the common wealth building. (if you use the left elevators, turn right as you come out the elevators, then turn left, go all the way to the end of the hallway, go through the doors, turn right, go through the doors again, and the office is the first door on the right. There should be a sign saying ICT office. Please note their drop in hours are between 13:00-14:00 i think).

Once you have access, you can connect to the [research data store](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/rds/) by going to `Go > Connect to Server > smb://rds.imperial.ac.uk/RDS/user/yourusername > connect`.

## Transferring and Sharing Data

You can use [Globus](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/rds/globus/) to share and transfer data from your RDS to an external site. [Log into Globus][1], select **Imperial College London** from the trusted organisations in the drop down list.

The first time you log in, you will need to register for a Globus account. 


## HPC Courses

Imperial offers courses on using the HPC system. You can find dates [here](https://wiki.imperial.ac.uk/display/HPC/Courses). I would recommend the `Beginner's guide to HPC at Imperial - from serial jobs to data parallelism` course. Before going on the course you will have to have some knowledge of the Linux command line such as the management comands `pwd, mkdir, cd, cp, mv, rm, cat, head, tail` and the nano text editor. If you are unfamiliar with these terms, please have a look [here](https://wiki.imperial.ac.uk/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=HPC&title=Command+line) first before the course.
